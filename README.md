# stopwatch-webapp

Created for personal use as a mini project

Utilizes flask to take in and proccess an input from the url (url input used instead of interface because of personal preference)

JavaScript manages client-side buttons and updates displays

To use simply add to the end of the url (some num)h for hours, (some num)m for minutes, and (some num)s for seconds, spaces are not necessary, any incorrect usage will simply redirect to a 00:00:00 timer
