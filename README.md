# stopwatch-webapp

Created for personal use as a mini project

Utilizes flask to take in and proccess an input from the url (url input used instead of interface because of personal preference)

JavaScript manages client-side buttons and updates displays

To use simply add to the end of the url _(some num)_ **h** for hours, _(some num)_ **m** for minutes, and _(some num)_ **s** for seconds, spaces are not necessary, any incorrect usage will simply redirect to a 00:00:00 timer

Example: https://emac-stopwatch.vercel.app/1h60m120s will create a timer of 02:02:00
